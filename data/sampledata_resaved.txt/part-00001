* From Intellij create a remote Run?Debug configuration using the port specified above, 5005
* to run any of the applications in the project at the command line type <br>
<code>$ spark-submit --class "fully qualfied app name"  --master local[4] target/jar file name.jar</code> <br>

example<br>

<code>$ spark-submit --class "com.wmb.spark.experiments.SimpleApp"  --master local[4] target/experimentsonspark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>

* since suspend=y the JVM will pause until a remote process attaches. From intellij launch your newly create remote run/debug configuration
* Note - this process can be improved but is good enough for this first development session

### For spark + scala
